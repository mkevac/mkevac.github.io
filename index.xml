      <description>At Badoo we have a distributed system that uses ssh on start to connect to each node and exchange some data.
Sometimes I&#39;ve seen ssh fail with error
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer error Usually, If you see this error, it means that server didn&#39;t like your certificate or you were banned from accessing this server.
The best way to debug this problem is to append -vvv while executing ssh client to increase verbosity and to do the same on server.</description>

      <description>We have some very strange memory corruption problem in one of our daemons. As one of the many approaches to find the bug, we have built and pushed to production this daemon, but without jemalloc, memory allocator library that we use in all our projects.
Few hours after the release monitoring team reported an unusal amount of errors returned from the system. It happens that few percent of the requests returned &amp;ldquo;out of memory&amp;rdquo; error.</description>
