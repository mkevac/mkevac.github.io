<p class="note-title">Encrypted DNS</p>
<p class="note-date">2020-01-02</p>
<p class="note-content">This is a bunch of notes taken from “DNS over HTTPS considerations” by Bert Hubert.
It’s an amazing talk and I recommend watching it. It covers the history of DNS security, privacy considerations, state-of-the-art and what awaits us in the future.
 DNS is one of the oldest text protocols that are still widely used. Almost everything else we encrypted already.
There have been four tries to encrypt DNS:…</p></a><p class="note-labels"><a class="article-category" href="/categories/notes/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>notes</a><a class="article-category" href="/categories/talks/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>talks</a><a class="article-tag" href="/tags/dns/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>dns</a><a class="article-tag" href="/tags/networking/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>networking</a><a class="article-tag" href="/tags/security/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>security</a><a class="article-tag" href="/tags/tls/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>tls</a><a class="article-tag" href="/tags/talks/"><span class="hashtag">#</span>talks</a></p></li><li><a class="note" href="/posts/new-blog/">
